Our eyes might have crossed and met each other numerous times as we crossed the path. Hope I made a good impression, as at least attempts were made from my side. An inexplicable urge to just stop you and ask you if you were up for a coffee next evening as my gaze and path cross you. Enough with all that cheesy litter. Here's to you, Dhruv M. from Btech 18 MSE. I hope you achieve every dream of yours and get what you want in your life. You're hardworking, intelligent and, charismatic. Keep it up, and Thank you for making every minute worth in library. (I kinda have a feeling you know who I am, right!? Mind you, It's all in good fun, not being creepy at all :p)"
