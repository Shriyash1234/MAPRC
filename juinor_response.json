We played every evening for almost two years and you guys were surely more persistent and regular than us. Aap log k saath Inter-IIT nhi jaane milega is baat ka bohat dukh hai. Everyone has taught us many things which will be useful on and off the field. \n#sorryadibhaiya #gannajuice@kartikhilal #sridharneharshbhaiya_ko_run_nhi_maare #MVPkogiftmilega\n\nBlithchron provided me with the chance to get to know some of the best seniors I have had. Late night meetings where the plan to call biswa for pronites was hot topic to ending up with a lot of fuckups and learnings on the DDay, you guys taught me many many things. Bohat table kurssi uthwaye but kaam karne me bohat maja aaya. Agle blith me sabko invitation aaega and please to come. \n#behoshpranshubhaiya #kaaladil@aarish #sorry_wrapupgang #tyd\n\nHow can I forget some seniors who were there whenever I needed any help. These were the people I looked upon jab bhi koi chhoti se chhoti takleef aa jaaye. No need to mention the names, but thank you very much for providing me with every gyaan whenever it was necessary. \n#blurredmemories #crushgang #sparkchahiye #lifedumb \n\nSome people helped me with every knowledge to stay acad focussed in this institute, kaunsa course le, kaha se padhe and kis professor k saath project kare, every question was answered by them. Thank you very much for proof-reading the SOPs, mails and Cvs a hundred times. I will try to be as useful and approachable as you to my juniors. \n\nIn the end, 'Shivanshu bhaiya aur mails crow!'",
