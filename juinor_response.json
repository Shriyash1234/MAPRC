We played every evening for almost two years and you guys were surely more persistent and regular than us. Aap log k saath Inter-IIT nhi jaane milega is baat ka bohat dukh hai. Everyone has taught us many things which will be useful on and off the field. \n#sorryadibhaiya #gannajuice@kartikhilal #sridharneharshbhaiya_ko_run_nhi_maare #MVPkogiftmilega\n\nBlithchron provided me with the chance to get to know some of the best seniors I have had. Late night meetings where the plan to call biswa for pronites was hot topic to ending up with a lot of fuckups and learnings on the DDay, you guys taught me many many things. Bohat table kurssi uthwaye but kaam karne me bohat maja aaya. Agle blith me sabko invitation aaega and please to come. \n#behoshpranshubhaiya #kaaladil@aarish #sorry_wrapupgang #tyd\n\nHow can I forget some seniors who were there whenever I needed any help. These were the people I looked upon jab bhi koi chhoti se chhoti takleef aa jaaye. No need to mention the names, but thank you very much for providing me with every gyaan whenever it was necessary. \n#blurredmemories #crushgang #sparkchahiye #lifedumb \n\nSome people helped me with every knowledge to stay acad focussed in this institute, kaunsa course le, kaha se padhe and kis professor k saath project kare, every question was answered by them. Thank you very much for proof-reading the SOPs, mails and Cvs a hundred times. I will try to be as useful and approachable as you to my juniors. \n\nIn the end, 'Shivanshu bhaiya aur mails crow!'",

But thik hai, you've been my stress-buster whenever needed (jab bhi mili hai, wrna toh bade log milte hi kahan). We’ve had so many good memories together, all those roasting and even self roasts, all those plan cancels (obviously by you). Now that we say a goodbye to you (ye phle hi likh chuka tha sab), I'm very happy and wish that you prosper a lot in your life (formality). \nGenuinely - Teri smile bht mast hai. Just don't forget to keep that smile on your face no matter what (baaki, kabhi smile jaaye toh me toh hun hi :) Aur tu toh Graduate bhi nahi ho rhi bc, bas ek dikhane ke liye extra degree le rhi hai :\/",

My life at IITGN has been a roller-coaster (yeah I know....so cliché 🙄) for me but I have never been tensed because I knew that you guys were with me. In every step of our life that we have taken since the past 3 years, you have guided, worked and celebrated with us. If I haven't told you in person, then I am saying it here, thank you for being there. Every single one of you has made IITGN as it is today - perfect.\n\nAt last, I don't think I need to wish you the best because you are the best and you are going to nail whatever you are going to do!

Remember when you first asked me out? I was hesitant because I had my PE makeover session. Then you told me there's a way to makeup for my classes in some other way as well. When I asked how, you were like, \"Lets get going now, I will tell you on the way!\". And from that moment, there was no looking back. My life changed for the best!
