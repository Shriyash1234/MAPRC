From organizing events, sharing trauma experiences, walking countless miles to getting trolled together - our friendship has unlocked a quite diverse and representative list of achievements. Your rants against poetry and introverts will be engraved on my heart forever. Feeling so content to see your conversion into a poetry person. Will keep sending prayers so that you keep acing (hopefully not in the way I'll be acing mine ;)) in your academic and personal life, insha'Allah. Couldn't be more grateful to have found you. Dosti bani rahe. xD\n\n\"t≈´ shƒÅhƒ´√± hai parvƒÅz hai kaam terƒÅ \ntire sƒÅmne ƒÅsmƒÅ√± aur bhƒ´ hai√±\"\n \nYour very own Shah,\nBeenish.",

Agr mujhe kbhi bhi pizza khana hota tha you was my go to man. Hum roomates bhi bne aur wo time bhi bahut acha tha.  Wo DMart ki trips, 7.30 bje mohini mess ka udghatan krna.  I have spent some of my most wonderful time with you. Just remember you will always be my mota bhai. I may not have been with you in some of things but I will be in touch with you forever. So Don't forget me. All the best for your future. ",

The 3AM talks we had in J-205 and then in J-217 and nearby rooms were life changing. Whatever I write doesn't matter, words are irrelevant between us. Even after I shifted to E and against all my fear that the physical distance will bring distance in our brotherhood, everything remained the same. We are brothers for lifetime. I hope ki I get Bangalore only, then we can throw parties as we've already planned and make new connections with people from a variety of background and in the process find someone special for you!

Having you as my first ever roommate in life was a real flex, and I will cherish this experience. \n\nYour speed of running (behind your beloveds), your love for PUBG and your weird arguments are really insane for me to process, but I'm sure everyone else feels that way too! You are one great character, and stay such! First year me SML jheetne se leke, final year me ladkiyon ka adress puchne tak kaafi kuch achieve kar liya hai tune. \n\nKeep up the good work, aur milte rehna!",

I am proud that I had a very special gujarati friend that too from ahmedabad. Well wishes for your future bro. ",

It was also a great pleasure playing my last SML with you, and setting records , unlike other records we set in Volleyball  Intramurals xD. \n\nAnd of course you've been a great friend to me, and a highly powerful politician to the college, that someone can always find in IITGN's history books! \n\nKeep vibing to good music as always, fly high aur.....Beedi ki mehfil jamaate hai fir kabhi Chachha! \n",

  "Message": "One of my biggest regrets over the past four years (if any), is that you came into my life too late. This past year with you has been one of the most memorable, and happiest years of my life. Be it ‚Äústudying‚Äù at block 6, or watching horror movies, or hearing you talking about your childhood stories for hours on end, I will cherish each and every memory I have of you for a very long time. From the bus ride in the batch trip where you were ‚Äúsick‚Äù, to that ski lift in Auli, to cycling on the riverfront, there are countless memories with you and countless memories yet to make. Thank you for being by my side throughout, and for taking care of me when I was down. I realized one thing recently, this past year I was happy when you were happy and I was sad when you were sad, and that sums up our connection. Purdue is a lucky place - it's getting a star basketball player (XD), a star badminton player and a great student, all in one. Never forget to keep smiling, cause it‚Äôs contagious. Oh, and I‚Äôm always gonna be around - it‚Äôs not like you know how to take care of yourself, you are the only girl that I would simp for.  Yours truly, Menon. (P.S. you know..)    ",

My earliest memory of you was when we went to the dispensary for a medical check-up and you almost fainted after the blood test. I always thought I was an overly-cautious scaredy cat, until I met you, XD. I have judged you a lot over the past 4 years, especially for your movie choices ‚Ä¶ 12 Angry Men? Really!? Welcome dekh, Welcome! But at the end of the day, I must say, I really admire your principles and your sense of ethics, and I wish, I develop even 50% of the qualities that you possess (the good ones, not the toxic ones) You are probably one of the most hardworking people I have ever met, I mean college ke last week mein bhi classes attend karne hai sir ko. I have seen how much you truly care about the people around you, especially during their tough times. I‚Äôm sure whatever lies ahead of you, you will ace it with flying colors. I wish you the greatest success in life. Beauki Gang for life (although you switched to Aibaan and left us three alone) Love you, Menon.

The instant I had a look at the email, I knew that the events at Amalthea were going to be excellent when you were there to lead them, I never really got a chance to know you before that, but a preexistent respect, a pre existent belief in your sincerety, in your leadership and more importantly in your support already existed, and the next 3 years would prove all those initial thoughts to be true.\n\nI have had most of my best memories at IITGN with you and I hope you can say the same. Indeed, be it the games we played, the walks we had, the spots we hung out at, the food we made, the movies we saw, the people we bitched about, the gossips we had, *pants* breathes in* *resumes rap again* the early morning breakfasts, the bike rides, the extra dishes ordered at restaurants, the tracking of orion at night and on and on. For other people reading this, I've just given you a list of things to do if you wanna have good time at IITGN, don't back away from sending me a thanks if you like it :)\n\nHaving you as a part of my life has been a blessing as you handle everything brilliantly. I have trusted you with my worst fears and my worst dejections and you have always been there to pat me on my back, give me some water, say some encouraging words and get me smiling and confident again (yupp, I might just be a dog). Thanks for being there to motivate me whenever I needed it. I am grateful to have you as a part of my life as I wouldn't have achieved all that I have if you weren't there. After all, who would have thought that a guy from state board would speak and write in such flawless english, a little help from an icse girl is all it takes :P\n\nI've been writing yearbook entries for the last few hours now, and my package of 1.5 GB humour per day was kind of getting exhausted, so it was necessary I add in some nostalgic details to get the text up. but the 100 free SMS of nostalgia are still pretty untilized. I speak from all my heart and this might be getting repetitive, but thanks for being there in my life Dhruvi, I am thankful for your support, your trust, your confidence, your smile, your efforts, and simply everything there is about you. Having you with me at IITGN made my experience many fold better than it already could be and I couldn't ask for anything more. Now, I am on the verge of getting very cheezy and I guess it's a sign for me to stop. Thanks for everything, and I hope you get the best in everything out there (one box has already been ticked)!\"",

From finding it difficult to communicate with each other to breaking down in the heat of emotions, I wish all of it would have been simpler to sort out.

From getting free meals at Mahindra Resorts in Munnar, to taking you the hospital at 3am after a long and tiring train journey in the heat of Bikaner. Booking hotels at the last moment and not bathing for 3 days just to save on hotel expenses, these memories never leave my mind, Having late night chats in on top of the hostel blocks and analyzing the crosses out lists of crushes which were obviously wrong XD.

Tere room pe aake pade rehna was the best part of the entire journey and shayad usski vajah se hi bond aur bhi mast hogaya. I really can‚Äôt remember when we got so close that it was impossible to imagine a day without talking to each other. I really can‚Äôt even remember when I started fighting with you. Mere nakhre, rona, jaghde sab bear kiya tune and aage bhi tuhje hi karna hai. Wo hum dono ki painting usse special kuch ho hi nhi sakta tha as a birthday gift. There was nothing special about us we both were too simple but you are routine. Sometimes we like to change the routine and to take a break but it is impossible to live without routine.

And now that I have known you for a year, I can say that that's an understatement.

Your talent for having the perfect shayari for the most random situation still amazes me..

The only time i was happy to be in a picture with you was during Prom #fakePromPartner. Baaki saari photos me, only one of us ever looks good (mostly me).

Yaad hai tere first bday pe maine galti se GPL kar diya tha? You totally deserved that. \nNevertheless, thanks for mostly being there for me and almost helping me deal with my issues. Hope you make more informed choices in the future because mere bina tera kya hi hoga...instagram ke liye posts kaun approve karega?\nAchha hua tu same university nahi aa rahi...finally peechha chhuta.

Random dances, the best jokes, great songs, movies, dresses, pretty photos, all sorts of conversations, food, ofc your DSLR and you! All pretty little things. You and your room are a different vibe. Have seen you from the first year for being one of the most energetic people out there. Thanks for being there, Navneet, quite literally. The next time you come home, can we go to that DIY shop and also paint a piece together? Be as sassy as you are!",

Koala. \nIf I shall count the number of jinx moments we have had till now, it'd be more than the number of minutes we spent making misogynistic remarks on women, and a lot of minutes were spent there. If I would have been gay, I am pretty sure you would have asked me out.\nThe guy with the most versatile sense of humor. The OG Memer of IITGN. From Metals to Metallica, Puns to Poetry, Humiliation to Humility, you name it and he's got it. Guy's got the range, cause that's his domain. Sorry for the math joke - I know you're not good at math but I'm not good at jokes either. \nOur relation, at times, has been bittersweet, but I know country roads take you home. I know Madrid always makes a comeback. I've known your likes, your dislikes, your fears, your insecurities and I'm sure you know mine as well. We've shared beds, let alone our emotions or feelings. \nI know I have been like a moral police to you for a long time. It was not because I wanted to take your freedom away, but to protect you from what I thought might not be good for you. Maybe I didn't do it the right way, and could have done it better. But in the end, it doesn't even matter. I had no ill-will. And I know you don't have anything against me either. You know how? Because I have seen you standing up for me as well as standing besides me. I have seen us laughing together while watching Comedy Factory videos. And that is exactly why, if we ever had a war cry, it would be \"Aasaan Hai!\" \nThere's a reason I called you a knight, as I know how you ride into the battlefield called \"life\". Tu Shunya Pe Sawaar Hai!",

It's still not accepted in the society! Relax guys, we were just cracking dark jokes on a particular community. \nMoreover, our leaked chats (both online and offline) would burn a lot of people's asses, and I don't know why but I like it.

You know better than most people what I have been through and I know better than most what you have been through. It just feels so beautiful how we‚Äôre so different is so many respects yet so we're so different in so many ways yet so similar in so many others and despite all of our differences, here we are. I couldn't have asked for a better best friend, confidant and support system during my toughest times. Both of us have seen each other at our worst and lifted each other up from those places, and I‚Äôll forever be grateful to IITGN for giving me such a wonderful friend, a friend with whom I want to share all of my experiences, happiness, sadness, everything; a friend for life. And you better keep up your end of this, as will I: we‚Äôre friends for life. No matter what happens, where life takes us, how many days we go by without talking to each other, i‚Äôll always come back one day to give you a tapli and wake you up with terrible, terrible marathi (zoples nahi kambde, aaichya gaawat). I believe this is the part where people usually mention the memories they‚Äôve had together, but I just can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs so fucking many. Sooooo many. Emiet ka room, J ka room, explorer‚Äôs, Goa, batch trip, H ke rooms, it‚Äôs unbelievable how many memories we have together. Poora din saath mei rehne se din mei ya week mei ek baar milne ka transition was really difficult in third year. I don‚Äôt know how im gonna bear not seeing you for years now. But this is definitely not over, someday, maybe when you‚Äôre all settled down, i‚Äôll just appear at your door out of nowhere and give you a tight hug. Kyuki mujhe bhi pata hai na, kya hi karega tu mere bina. I know I suck at maintaining relationships. I have lost touch with all of my school friends. There might come times when it might seem like I‚Äôve forgotten you, but thats never ever gonna happen. You will always be a go-to person for me if something goes wrong. Bhai hai tu mera. Chal ab bahut ho gaya, bhag jaa ab yaha se, itna essay likh likh ke bore ho gaya mai. Just one last thing. I know it‚Äôs cliche, but its so appropriate. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a long day. Without you my friend. And I‚Äôll tell you all about it when I see you again. \n",

Chimair 3rd floor ke baad toh bhai sahab yeh aisa chipka hai saath mai ke choode nahi choot tey. This guy is the living embodiment of the sentence I always say,\"Life mai sincere bano, serious nahi\". This MF will crack a haathi-cheenti joke in the midst of your hard times and the joke will be so so sooo bad that you will completely forget what your sorrows were. Do gaali doge lekin chehre pe smile zarur aa jayegi. Iske saath rehke smuggler bhi ban gaya; mai hi nahi, Gaurav Dalmia bhi smuggling mai shaamil hai. After uncountable jugaads, broken rules, broken ankles in DJ nights, broken bottle seals (well, this is countable but okay), when I look back to 1st year, we really came a long way. From meeting in India's football match to going in IPL semi-final together, I absolutely loved forging (pun intended) this friendship. Aise hi always full of life, confidence and josh ke bane rehna. Baaki toh milte rahenge, kaha hi bhaage jaa rahe hai. Also, wo farewell letter aur jersey sambhaal ke rakhna. Iss entry se jyada mehnat se likha tha. P.S: Bhai abhi nahi chhadhi ek aur bana de.

I was waiting for my turn during Sem 1 Viva Voce and this guy was in there for so long talking about all kinds of stuff. I thought to myself, bc kitna bolta hai yeh insaan. Cut to final year when both of us don't stop talking when we start vibing. There are so many things that we vibe on; old music, bolly movies, memes, mech stuff and so much more. I never knew I needed a Dalmia Seth in my life. Baaki Dalmia Seth ke toh kya kehne. Hisaab ekdum barabar yaad rehta hai ise. It's 3 am, you're in your room alone minding your business, when you hear a knock on the door. Who is it? It's Dalmia Seth!! You never know when & where the long talks with him will end. Seedha breakfast karke hi sona pakka hai XD. There are so many things that make up Dalmia Seth (Amul being the most important) and all of them unique in their own way! You bring a whole different energy to the room you're in. Authoratative, Jugaadu & Calm guy, taught me the very important skill of how to outsource work :haha:. Our long ranting calls after exams in 5th sem, to in-person rants about a certain someone rhyming with Bhaiyyagiri; gonna miss it a lot.

Wise, Mature, calm and composed in his ways, his Highness Khichi helped me attain a strange balance in life. Whenever I had a problem, talking to his highness would either help me solve it or help me gather the courage to face it. King Khichi truly is the father of the group. Or as he'd like to be called, #DADDYKHICHI. Cuz we all know \"Who's your Daddy?!!\". In Hostel J 2nd floor, I was very out of balance. Long talks with Lord Khichi helped so much. Our highness also loves to see people fight; cuz after good discussion, when srujan was in room, Lord Khichi often used us two as tools to his entertainment by inciting quarrels regarding a certain someone. After his amusement; he used to turn to his royal display and binge the fcuk out of it. Then he slept for long hours and sometimes woke up late for class. I was once entrusted with the responsibility of waking up his highness for Solids' class. I too overslept which resulted in us being late. Never before had we faced such humiliation before. I still begged for sir to let us sit in the class; but not lord Khichi. He left as soon as he entered without stopping to glance at the prof. The prof was not worthy of his highness's attention anyway. I hope to continue to be a loyal servant of the Khichi empire and contribute to it's growth just as it has helped me grow. \nP.S: I haven't found anyone who can vibe with me so hard on old songs as daddy khichi.

Also, I never thought that I would even have a chance with someone if you hadn't pushed me lol... so thanks for that üëÄ Anyways, all the best for your journey ahead and we know that you are going to rock it because you are one hell of a person! Aur ha, aapke haath ka khana nahi kha paya mein even in the end. Toh next time taiyar rehna, mein toh chammach aur fork k saath hi milunga!"

I still remember your face against the monkey climber when we were there in the temporary ground and you were sad(lol) for the prank we did. You are so adventurously stupid. But still mature idiot. I doubt you for being singleüòÇ. Our starting days near lal minar, director house, cycle rides were the best. You are so short to reach the sky by height but not by heart. But pata nahi kahan kahan adventure naam peh ghum jaati h. I still remember your face when you used to slide the slope in the central archade terrace. Many days you have been sucha support. I love the way you enjoy your own company. Stay the same. Hope you liked that birthday surprise of bhaiya playing guitar. You live like a song which can be understood by only few people. I am lucky that I was one among the few. We won the iitgn got talent \nDuet but hume to kuch mila nahi. Uska practice sessions b bahut maza aaya. Photos b ache aaye te. All the best for your futur bro..bas tere jaise tujhe ek husband mil jaye. Itti si h par dil bahut bada h.",

Tech Meet mein bhi bohot maza aaya tha yaar. Woh din bhi yaad rahenge mujhe. Ekdum zabardasti iss world mein problems dhoondhte rehte the lol. EE, Projects mein saath nibhane ke liye shukriya. Mujhe samajh nahi aata tha jab tu final year mein haste hue nikalti thi, aisa lagta tha tujhe koi secret pata hai but batati nahi thi. But theek hai shayad mujhe pata hai ki tujhe kya pata hai lol. Kitna jaldi time nikal gaya, Aisa lagta hai kal hi college aaye the. FP shuru hi hua tha. But sab over ho gaya hai. Strange feeling hai. Suna hai US jaa rahi hai. Mere baare mein logon ko batana. Koi interested ho toh mujhe bhi batana. Kuch share karna hua toh share bhi kardena. All the best best Pelek Pumrohitz. Hope to see you againüíö.",
